NOTE - News feeds that can cause problems

Some news feeds contain HTML (the code that makes up website pages rather than just plain text) plus hyperlinks in it's news item descriptions.  These are designed to display as much as possible on desktop RSS news readers.  The Repeat Signage RSS control is designed to display plain text descriptions as it either scrolls or ticker-tapes news onto the screen.  Repeat Signage will convert the HTML to plain text, but some news feeds go over the top a bit will the HTML and include tables and multiple hyperlinks.  This may mean with some news feeds that you will get odd text as when the HTML is removed, Repeat joins the text left over up together. 

An example of this are some of the Google news feeds, for example:

http://news.google.com/?output=rss

If you click the above link to open the news feed in your browser, you will see the descriptions (the text between <description> and </description> in news items contains HTML tables and loads of hyperlinks.
